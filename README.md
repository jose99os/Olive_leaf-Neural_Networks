# Olive_leaf-Neural_Networks
This repository contains two codes for creating two neural networks used for the recognition of olive leaves images, one without augmented data enhancement and one with augmented data. 
There is also a folder with the data for training. Among these images are three different classes: leaf images infected with Aculus olearius, images infected with Olive peacock spot and the healthy leaves .
Also contains two folder with two neuronal networks ready for load and use.
The data set was created by Sinan UÄŸuz and Nese Uysal. Original link: https://github.com/sinanuguz/CNN_olive_dataset
